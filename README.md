# Enhancing Document Classification using LayoutLMv2

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** implementation of a document classification model using **LayoutLMv2**, with a comparative analysis against a VGG16-based model. The results highlight the advantages of combining text and layout features for enhanced document classification accuracy.

## Project Overview

Document classification plays a critical role in organizing and processing large-scale document data. This project demonstrates the use of **LayoutLMv2**, a transformer-based model that integrates textual and layout information, to classify documents effectively. 

A comparative analysis was conducted against a **VGG16-based model**, highlighting the superior performance of LayoutLMv2 for tasks involving contextual understanding.
